### Hi, I'm Karina 👋

Welcome to my humble (and slightly chaotic) virtual programming space 🛠️
Things might look a bit messy around here — I’m constantly experimenting, breaking stuff, fixing it, and experimenting some more… all in the name of learning.

If something feels unfinished, that’s intentional.
If something is broken, I’m probably in the middle of fixing it.
And if I suddenly disappear — I’m likely playing Final Fantasy VII 🎮

Chaos is part of the process ✨
